    "\n",
    "This is the fourth project of the Udacity Data Analysis Course. The project is about wrangling the data of the Twitter_archive dataset from the Twitter user @dog_rates also known as WeRateDogs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Steps \n",
    "\n",
    "- step 1: Gathering data.\n",
    "- step 2: Assessing data.\n",
    "- step 3: Cleaning data.\n",
    "- step 4: Visulization.\n",
    "- step 5: Storing data.\n",

    "## Gathering data \n",
    "\n",
    "### Twitter_archive_enhanced\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 datasets we have worked on. The first one is the 'Twitter archive file' this dataset was provided by udacity and it contains all 5000+ tweets. I have downloaded it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### image_archive_enhanced\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is the image prediction and it contains a prediction of the dogs. this dataset is hosted on udacity's servers and we were able to download it by using the Request library. \n",
    "\n",
    "### tweet_json_txt \n",
    "\n",
    "The last data can be gathered using Twitter API and from the tweepy library, but I couldn't so I downloaded it manually from udacity. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Asessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is important after gathering, and it can be done visually or progammeticlly. in this step I have document some of the quality and itdiness issues. Some of them are \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality \n",
    "\n",
    "- timestamp must be datetime\n",
    "- denominator has values other than 10\n",
    "- delete None values \n",
    "- numerator has invaild numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness \n",
    "\n",
    "- all dogs have to be in one column \n",
    "- p1,p2,p3 should be category and should be in one column\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I have cleaned the data by using what I have learned from udacity and I have used google when I get stuck. some of the websites I have used ( included it in Readme file) is StackOverflow,w3school, geeksforgeeks etc.. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization \n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning the data I used Corr() function and PieChart to visualize some of the analysis \n",

    "## Storing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part is storing the data in a CSV file by using the to_csv function.\n"
